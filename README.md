RUST on the day I am writing this has no good support of x86 Android, and no official support of x86_64 Android.
However, I have a very powerful Nokia N1 tablet, and with TERMUX installed, which is a very good mobile platform for rust programming.

So, I decide to cross compile rustc to make it work on x86_64-linux-android target.
After may times failure, I found japaric/ruststrap scripts are the most valuable baseline.

In the latest rust nightly build, following code changes are needed to introduce a new target:
1) target makefile under mk/cfg
2) target specification under src/librustc_back/target, which includes two files - one new target triplet definition, and one loading control
3) usually some os/arch/target related changes under src/libstd/os
